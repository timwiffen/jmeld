JMeld is a visual diff and merge tool. It is build to be fast with large files and runs on any operating system.

It is modelled after the fantastic program 'meld'. (see http://meld.sourceforge.net/)
It is not nearly as fantastic as meld but it is a start!

JMeld can be compiled with the command:
"ant"

Start jmeld with the command:
"java -jar JMeld.jar <file1> <file2>
